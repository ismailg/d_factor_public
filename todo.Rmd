Look at trial by trial likelihpopds for all three methods for same participant and compare. 

check for those using w=1 whether LL is similar to MB. 


Studies to depth of planning : how may steps do people take ? 
How far do people plan? how much people plan? 
parametrised functions of values  DONE 


same loss function as loglikelhood before. at the end we are trying to compare models. reinitialise at every time point or let it run

DONE 

subscale = alpha  + beta guilt + beta2 envy ..... DONE 

right now, we don't see much difference in behavior between d_levels. BUT; do we see differences in behavior between models of d_level groups assuming infinite trial simulation (1000 trials).... you can do this simulations with that playing against HMM over long time windows.
